# luvit-custom-binary-starter

A starter for a Luvit custom binary. [Isolated (stolen) from the Luvit examples](https://github.com/luvit/luvit/tree/master/examples/custom-binary).

### Setup

Install the dependencies with Lit, but running `lit install`.

### Running

You can run the app without building by running `luvi .` in the root directory.

### Building

Running `make binary` will build the app for you, it is an alias for running `lit make .`. The output will be a file called `custom-binary`. This can be executed like any other binary by running `./custom-binary`.
